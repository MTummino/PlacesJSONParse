# PlacesJSONParse
Contains the portion of the code meant to take Google Places Nearby Search data and provide a list of locations. 
The Demo version includes a hardcoded UI portion that was run during the Montco Tech Connect. 
The other version includes a main class tester.  When implemented with the rest of the project, the intent would be for the information to be passed in separately.
